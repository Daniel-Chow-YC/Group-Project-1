# Python Environment Project

## Timings

3 Days

## Summary

We have a created a console JSON application that can gather data from IT Jobs Watch.

Your job is to create working development, testing and production environment and to build a pipeline to move the code through them using Jenkins. This will include your application and configuration code.


Note: We will need to add the group to Repo on GitHub before it is accessible.


You can clone the code for the application from the following repo:

https://github.com/spartaglobal/It_Jobs_Watch_Data_Package

You should fork this repo to one of your own.

## Tasks

### Python App Pipeline



Create a development environment using Vagrant and provision it with Chef such that it can run the application successfully.
	Create an AMI using packer and your cookbooks that is capable of running the application and configure Jenkins to use this as a slave
	Create a Jenkins job that listens for Webhooks from your forked repo and starts a testing job
	Run the tests in the application on the slave node
	Create a job that builds your AMI when all tests have passed using packer.


### Chef Python Cookbook Pipeline



Create a development pipeline for your Python cookbook.
	Create a Jenkins job that listens for Webhooks from your Python Cookbook repo and starts a testing job.
	Run tests using Chef Kitchen in the Cloud.
	Create a job that will merge your changes to your configuration to the master branch which can then be used by the pipeline above.


### Deliverables



Python cookbook stored in a github repo ( separate ) with Jenkins pipeline.
	- Forked ItJobsWatch application repo with Vagrantfile, Berksfile, packer.json and ability to simply Vagrant up and run in development.
	- Jenkins Job that runs test suite on pushes to master branch of forked application repo.
	- Separate Jenkins job that buils an application AMI using packer.json when tests pass successfully.

# For the Dev Environment
- Simply run vagrant up
- Vagrant ssh to get into the VM
- cd to It_Jobs_Watch_Data_Package-master
- Run `python3 main.py` to run the app
- or
- Run `python3 -m pytest tests/` to run the tests for the app
